# BrewTrackr

A responsive web application that pulls data from FourSquare API and allows users to search for coffee or breweries in any city. The app allows users to keep track of their favorite brew places.

## Introduction
BrewTrackr is a coffee/breweries tracking app that goes above and beyond a simple search app. The app allows users to create an account and keep track of their favorite coffee and breweries. BrewTrackr will allow users to save any brew place and write/edit their own reviews on each place. Keep track of all your favorite coffee/breweries and write your own reviews/comments with BrewTrackr! Create an account and get started.

## Live Demo

## Note
The Foursquare API currently has a rate limit of 500 premium API calls per day. As of May 31, 3018 I had to add another Foursquare API endpoint to get Foursquare venues photos (premium calls) so this application will only be able to make 500 calls per day. If the daily quota max is used up, results will not be shown but will be available to use the next day.
